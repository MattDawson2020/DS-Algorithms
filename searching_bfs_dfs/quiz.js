// if you know solution is not far from the root of the tree
// BFS

// if the tree is very deep and solutions are rare
// BFS -> DFS will take a very long time, DFS is often recursive so it may overflow -> DFS WITH A QUEUE?


// if the tree is very wide
// DFS -> BFS will use too much memory as it must store each node in a level

// if solutions are frequent but located deep within the Tree
// DFS


// determining whether a pth exists between two Nodes
// DFS


// finding the shortest path
// BFS
